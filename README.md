# TextRecognition
Text Recognition using mlkit
For testing we are taking drawable image in next update we will use camera
640x480 image might work well to scan a business card that occupies the full width of the image
To scan a document printed on letter-sized paper, a 720x1280 pixel image might be required
Poor image focus can affect text recognition accuracy.
If you aren't getting acceptable results, try asking the user to recapture the image.
